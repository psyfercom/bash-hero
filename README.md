## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

First things first, let's get you set up with Bash-Hero:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bash-hero.git
cd bash-hero
```

```

### 3. Start Your Adventure

On your first boot, you'll be asked to enter your hero's name. This is the beginning of your epic journey!

## 🎮 How to Play

### 🛡️ The Basics

Once you've chosen your hero's name, your journey begins! Here's what you can expect:

- **Hearts:** Your health! Don't let them run out, or it's game over!
- **Rupees:** The currency of champions. Find them as you explore, but they're rare!
- **XP:** Your experience points. Gain XP by performing actions and level up your hero!
- **Actions:** Every command you run counts as an action. Keep track!

### 🧙 Commands & Controls

Your hero's journey is command-line driven. Here are some things you can do:

- **Type commands:** Run any terminal commands as usual. Each command you execute brings you closer to leveling up!
- **Level Up:** Gain XP by performing actions. Watch your hero grow stronger!
- **Heal:** Keep an eye on your hearts. If they get low, better take a break or find a potion! (Hint: Run the `potion` command to heal.)

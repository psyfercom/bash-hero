# Bash Hero: Your Terminal-Based RPG Adventure Awaits! 🛡️🎮

Welcome to **Bash Hero**, the terminal-based RPG you never knew you needed! Perfect for when you’re stuck in the terminal and want to procrastinate—err, *enhance your productivity*—with a touch of old-school gaming. 🎯

## Features

- **❤️ Hearts & 💎 Rupees**: Because who doesn’t love a good currency and life system? Collect rupees with a very realistic chance of zero, while trying to avoid losing all your hearts (spoiler: you’ll lose them anyway).
  
- **📈 XP and Leveling**: Earn XP as you type random commands and ascend to higher levels of greatness. The XP bar? It’s as long as your procrastination streak. We’re talking ASCII art at its finest.

- **🎨 Customizable Experience**: Choose your font, emojis, and even color scheme because why settle for default when you can personalize your doom?

- **💾 Persistence**: Progress is saved in a JSON file, so you can pick up your heroic (or tragic) journey right where you left off. It’s like a save state, but cooler because it’s in a JSON.

- **🔍 Interactive Menus**: We’ve got a main menu and a settings menu because why not make you work a little for those sweet, sweet customizations?

- **⏳ Lose Hearts Every 100 Actions**: We know you're going to be *super* productive, but just in case, we’ll take a heart every 100 actions. No hard feelings, right?

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/psyfercom/bash-hero.git
   cd bash-hero
   ```

2. **Run the Game**:
   ```bash
   ./bash-hero.sh
   ```

3. **Start Your Adventure**: If you’ve got the guts, go ahead and start the game. If not, well, you’re already here.

## Usage

### Starting the Game
When you run the game for the first time, you’ll be prompted to enter your hero’s name. Choose wisely; this is your digital legacy (until you delete the JSON file). 🏰

### Main Game Loop
Type commands to perform actions. Here's a sample to get you started:
```bash
menu  # Open the main menu
exit  # Save and exit the game
```
You can type pretty much any other command, and the game will let you do it—mostly because it’s a terminal. 🖥️

### Menus

- **📜 Main Menu**: View your hero’s profile, access settings, or quit when you realize you have actual work to do.
  
- **⚙️ Settings Menu**: Change fonts, customize emojis, or alter colors. There’s even an option to add this script to your PATH because why shouldn’t `bash-hero` be your new terminal default?

## Customization Options

- **🖋️ Fonts**: Set your preferred font for that retro RPG look and feel.
  
- **😊 Emojis**: Pick your heart and empty heart emojis—because we all express heartbreak differently.

- **🌈 Color Schemes**: Choose your preferred terminal color scheme. There’s no judgment if you pick green to feel like a hacker from the ‘90s.
